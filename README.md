# WallpaperExploitApp
Android app to demonstrate an exploit of trust using a Live Wallpaper

Simply download the project and open in it Android Studio to get going!  
Unless you are testing the app against [our existing website here](https://openshell.nextproject.ca/), you will need to host it yourself using [the code found here.](https://github.com/uoitdnalab/OpenShellSite)  
If you have hosted the site yourself, all you will have to do is change the IP address in the script file to that of your server.  
This script can be found under `LiveWallpaper/app/src/main/assets/script.sh` and has a single line where the IP needs to be changed.  
Once the script's IP is changed, build the app and install it to one of your devices to test against your server.  
FYI, you can change the build configuration Default Activity to Nothing to supress the run warning.  

This code was originally adapted by another student from a live wallpaper example.  
It is now being maintained by myself, Dylan Kauling, under the supervision of Qusay H. Mahmoud at UOIT.
